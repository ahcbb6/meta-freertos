# FreeRTOS ARM926ejs bsp class
#
# This class contains code that could potentially change depending
# on the specific PORT for which FreeRTOS is being built for, but
# it still inherits the freertos-image class which contains the
# "image" wiring for oe-core to work properly.
# If other PORTs were to be used, a class similar to this one
# should potentially be used.
