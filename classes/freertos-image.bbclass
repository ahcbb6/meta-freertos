# FreeRTOS image class
#
# This class is meant to be inherited by recipes for FreeRTOS apps
# It contains code that would be used by all of them, where every 
# recipe would just need to override certain parts.
#
# For scalability purposes, code within this class focuses on the
# "image" wiring that makes apps work properly with openembedded-core
# infrastructure.

# We are getting the FreeRTOS source code from upstream (this class)
# We have a BSP repo where we get the portable code from (bsp class)
# And we get the app code from a different repo (app recipe)
